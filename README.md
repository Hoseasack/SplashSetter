# SplashSetter
The easy way to setup a splash for GIMP.

## What is SplashSetter?
SplashSetter is a easy to use GUI PowerShell script which allows you to effortlessly change the default GIMP splash screen.

## How do I use the script?
Just download the script from the "[Releases](https://github.com/Hoseasack/SplashSetter/releases/latest)" page and run with PowerShell. No installing needed!

## Is this safe?
This script does not change nor touch any system files. This is also a portable script.

## Can I use this script offline?
As of now, you need an active internet connection to download splashes. The plan in the future is to allow an offine version of the script and a download button on the normal version.

## What's next?

- Add more splashes
- Add more programs
- Add image caching
- Add local file support
- ...
